World Generator
===============

The ultimate goal of this project is to use the patterns described in the book
"A Pattern Language" by Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, and Murray
Silverstein. Ideally this program will generate a world through a combination
of top-down algorithms meant to mimic real-world patterns, and simulations of
changes over time. Like the book, the result should range in detail from the
very large scale, distribution of cities, to the small scale, individual
features in a house or business.

Notes.txt will include notes on each chapter and how to implement it.
